    <!--Introduction of Lisbon-->
    
    <header>Lisboa menina e moça</header>
    <p>Lisbon is the capital of Portugal. It's the largest Portuguese city and the 11th of Europe. Around 3 million people live in what we call "Aerea Metropolitana de Lisboa".</p>
    <p> Lisbon is the city I was born, but I was raised in a civil parish called Amora.</p>
    <p> In Amora we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagus">Tagus River (Rio Tejo)</a> that is a very beautiful walking pass to go to our neighbour city Seixal.</p>
    <p> Amora has developed a lot in the last 10 years, creating new ways of becoming a great city for the young people.</p>
    <p> Is close enough to Lisbon, and it has amazing infra-estructures and schools.</p>
    <p> As a avid runner, Amora is a great place for a lovely run, because it has the pavement for it and the weather!</p>
    <p>This little civil parish, has a very famous football club called Amora FC. Many great football players and coaches have come from there.</p>

    <!--Continuation of description-->

    <p>Another great thing from Amora, and Portugal in general is the food.</p>
    <p>In Lisbon, we have great fish and amazing cakes.</p>
    <p>On my last trip to Portugal, I visited a fantastic restaurant called "Sinal Vermelho" (Red light).</p>
    <p>They had a beautiful dish called "Açorda de marisco alentejana"</p>
